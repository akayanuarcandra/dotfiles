# aru's Dotfiles
soo what's actually dotfiles? i don't know but here's the configs and screenshots of my current workspace, for now i only config for windows (since i don't like how a default windows looks like) but later might be linux ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Also these configs are incredibly messy since i don't have much time to clean up unused things
## Windows
